## Inspiration

We were inspired by our own struggles to find the perfect off-campus housing, so we wanted to create a tool to ease this problem and help determine the most desired living location based on our preferences, such as location and criminal activity in the area.

## What It Does

We compiled commute data, real-time police reports, and more from several sources to provide  prospective tenants with unbiased, intuitive data  that enables them to compare many properties  with ease and flexibility.

## How We Built It

We built the frontend using React and Bootstrap, and the backend using Node.js and Express. Both were deployed to Google App Engine.
Using simple and easy-to-navigate user interface, we developed a webpage that utilizes Google Maps API and collects a database of real-time police reports. In the given 24 hours, we managed to split up the work efficiently and created a working and aesthetically-pleasing product.

## What's Next for SLOme

We plan to add more features to our web app such as estimating distances to your friends’ locations and having a financial budgeting aspect to calculate rent and help college students be more financially conscious when making housing decisions.
